 * This package is intentionally empty in appB.

 * AIDL interfaces shared between the apps live in each module's

 * into `build/generated/aidl_source_output_dir/...` during the build.
 *
 * We keep this placeholder so the package exists in VCS and IDEs don't
 * mark it as missing. Do not add duplicate generated AIDL stubs here;
 * keep AIDL sources in `src/main/aidl` only.
